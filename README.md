**Animoog + QuNeo gbControl version 0.1** (hackity hack hack)

Please distribute. Please improve. Credit me if you fork and/or distribute. Above all, distribute and improve on this template. It took me longer to write up the bare-bones documentation than it did to sketch out and CC-map the idea to begin with.

To use the mod wheel control (pad pressure) you may need to remap that in each preset that uses poly-pressure instead, or have fun and assign it independently.

QuNeo Editor v1.2 was used, be sure to update your firmware safely.

**Next Steps** (Surely, OP will deliver… *crickets*):

- Map Animoog's MIDI OUT to provide real-time performance data on the QuNeo (if I ever get around to buying that IAP)
- Group the banks more intelligently, and fill in any control gaps
- Add more scales as pad banks, maybe group major/minor via pad corners. Not too handy for live playing for us butterfinger types, though.
- X-Y assignments used intelligently. Pitch Bend is too unpredictable for me.

Thanks – gb
