Animoog + QuNeo gbControl version 0.1 (hackity hack hack)

Please distribute. Please improve. Credit if you feel the whim. Above all, distribute and improve on this template. It took me longer to write up the bare-bones documentation than it did to sketch out and CC-map the idea to begin with.

To use the mod wheel control (pad pressure) you may need to remap that in each preset that uses poly-pressure instead, or have fun and assign it independently.

QuNeo Editor v1.2 was used, be sure to update your firmware safely.

Next Steps (Surely, OP will deliverâ€¦ *crickets*):
- Map Animoog's MIDI OUT to provide real-time performance data on the QuNeo (if I ever get around to buying that IAP)
- Group the banks more intelligently, and fill in any control gaps
- Add more scales as pad banks, maybe group major/minor via pad corners. Not too handy for live playing for us butterfinger types, though.
- X-Y assignments used intelligently. Pitch Bend is too unpredicatable for me.

Thanks,
- gb
